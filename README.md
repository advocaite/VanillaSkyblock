Hey Crafters.

Today I bring you massive data pack packed full of goodies.
In this edition we are bringing out Vanilla Skyblock Server Edition r0.5
What is Skyblock you ask? well Skyblock is a gamemode that challanges people to build with a very limited start.
Limited as in a small island above y 200 so big drop if you fall off, you will find a small chest with some basic stuff and must build with what you have.
I wont spoil it all but  explain to you the many features revision 0.5 has .

Features: View Project Tab for everything...

	Island Creation System: with cooldowns so no spamming new islands.
	Ranks - 
		Newb: default rank.
		Helper: like a mod in training helps people out in chat.
		Mod: Can spectate other players in game.
		Admin: Does what a mods do but usally has op mode.
		Owner: As title says
	Spawn System: when inside spawn players are set to adventure mode and no PVP and when leaving set back to original ranks
	Home/SetHome/Delhome: All done with triggers. 
	TPA system: Teleport to another player or get them to teleport to you.
	Custom Challanges and advancments with rewards.40+
	Spawn triggers: teleport to spawn from your island.
	market Trigers: teleport to a market
	Economy system: full on money system
	Buy and Sell signs for your market with built in webpage to set them up
	Pay System: Pay players money 
	Custom loot tables for mobs
	UUID system: give each player a unique ID
	Vote system: allows for scorboard voteOflline to be set when a user votes with vanilla votifier or via Rcon
	Randomm cobble generator: gives random blocks when mining cobble.
	Obsidian to lava: acidently make obsidian when making a generator you can turn it back into a lava bucket.
	and much much more to come ;)...
