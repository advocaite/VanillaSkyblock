Hey Crafters.

Today I bring you decent data pack packed full of goodies.
In this edition we are bringing out Vanilla Skyblock Server Edition r0.9
What is Skyblock you ask? well Skyblock is a gamemode that challanges people to build with a very limited start.
Limited as in a small island above y 200 so big drop if you fall off, you will find a small chest with some basic stuff and must build with what you have.
I wont spoil it all but  explain to you the many features revision 0.9 has.
